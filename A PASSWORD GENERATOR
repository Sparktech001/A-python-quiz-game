#Password Generator Develop a password generator that creates random, secure passwords based on  user-defined criteria (e.g., length, inclusion of special characters).
# This project will help you understand random number generation and string handling. 
# the code should ask user for length of password which cannot be lower than 8
import random
import string
characters = string.ascii_letters + string.digits + string.punctuation
